# MAtmos 2020 "Zen"
The flagship soundpack, featuring seamless loops and indoors/outdoors variations for ambiences. It aims to add high quality sounds that enhance the atmosphere without feeling out of place. (MAtmos 34 or higher required.)

The Git repository only tracks the code; the sound files can be found in the releases.
